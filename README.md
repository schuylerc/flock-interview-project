# Flock Interview Project

### From the instructions:

This is an exercise to illustrate how you go about writing code and solving problems. We will discuss your solution
during your technical interview.

Write a script that will read in the included CSV file "input.csv", manipulate the data, and produce the included file "
output.json" as output.

You are allowed to use any resources, websites, libraries, etc. that you need to accomplish this task.

Requirements:

* Write in TypeScript
* Run with Node
* Provide instructions to execute your code

Please reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on implementation or requirements.

Code can be submitted via email, GitHub repo, or online code editor (Replit, CodeSandbox, etc).

### Dev Setup Notes

Please use Node `v20.13.1`. This package uses yarn, not npm (see below).

## Usage

| Command       | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| yarn          | Install dependencies.                        |
| yarn dev      | Start the dev version for local development. |
| yarn build    | Build and package the app for production.    |
| yarn start    | Start the production (built) version.        |
| yarn lint     | Run linting.                                 |
| yarn lint-fix | Run linting, and fix some things.            |
| yarn test     | Run tests.                                   |

When running the app requires an `input.csv` be present in the data directory. The `output.json` will be generated in
the
data directory when the app is run.
